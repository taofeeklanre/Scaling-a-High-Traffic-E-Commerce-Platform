1. ## Introduction
This document outlines the DevOps technical assessment I have prepared . The assessment focuses on identifying the root cause of performance degradation, implementing a scaling strategy to handle peak loads, and performing load testing to ensure the platform is robust and scalable.

##### The key objectives are:

•	To diagnose performance degradation through metrics and logs analysis.
•	To implement a scalable solution using AWS, Kubernetes, and other best practices.
•	To perform load testing to validate system performance under peak loads.

2. ## Root Cause Analysis

To identify the root cause of the performance degradation, I will follow a structured approach, examining various components of the system one by one.

##### Examine Metrics and Logs
1.	CloudWatch Metrics (AWS): I will monitor AWS CloudWatch to check key metrics like CPU, memory usage, network throughput, disk I/O, and request latencies for EC2 instances, RDS, and DynamoDB.
   
2.	Kubernetes Metrics (K8s): Using tools such as Prometheus and Grafana, I will monitor Kubernetes pod resource usage, node health, and service latencies. I will check for throttled, crashed, or restarted pods.
   
3.	Application Logs (Spring Boot): I will review logs for application errors, slow queries, or timeouts during peak load using Fluentd to forward logs to CloudWatch.
  
4.	Database Metrics (MySQL and DynamoDB): Reviewing slow query logs in MySQL and DynamoDB, I will use RDS Performance Insights to analyze query performance and identify potential bottlenecks.

##### Identifying Problems

•	Latency Spikes: I will analyze whether the degradation was caused by CPU/memory saturation, network bottlenecks, or inefficient database queries.

•	Microservice Performance: I will check performance across microservice-to-microservice calls, assessing network latency or service discovery issues.

•	Database Bottlenecks: I will investigate slow queries or contention in MySQL, and verify read/write throughput limits in DynamoDB.

•	Auto-scaling Failures: I will ensure that Kubernetes and AWS EC2 autoscaling worked as expected during peak load, reviewing scaling events.

3. ## Scaling Strategy
   
To effectively manage peak loads, I propose the following scaling strategies:

#### Database Scaling

1.	MySQL:

o	Read Replicas: I will add read replicas to handle read-heavy operations and reduce the load on the master database during peak times.

2.	DynamoDB:
   
o	On-Demand Mode: I will switch DynamoDB to on-demand capacity mode to automatically scale up and handle sudden traffic spikes.

#### Autoscaling in AWS
1.	Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA): I will configure Kubernetes HPA to automatically scale microservices based on metrics like CPU/memory usage and request latency.
   
2.	Cluster Autoscaler: I will enable AWS EKS Cluster Autoscaler to add or remove EC2 nodes when overall cluster resources are insufficient.
   
3.	Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs): I will ensure that ASGs for EC2 instances are configured to scale based on CPU utilization and request latency.
   
4.	Elastic Load Balancer (ELB): I will use ELB to distribute traffic efficiently across instances and enable sticky sessions for a better user experience.

### Architectural Changes
•	Caching: I will implement Amazon ElastiCache (Redis) to cache frequently accessed data, reducing the load on the databases.

•	Event-Driven Architecture: I will use Amazon SQS to handle spikes in asynchronous tasks, such as order processing or user notifications.

4. ## Load Testing
To validate the platform’s ability to handle peak traffic, I will set up a load-testing environment as follows:

##### Environment Setup
•	Staging Environment: I will create a staging environment that mirrors production in terms of infrastructure and configurations. Terraform will be used for provisioning infrastructure such as Kubernetes clusters and databases.
##### Tools for Load Testing
•	Apache JMeter: I will use JMeter to simulate heavy HTTP traffic, generating requests based on real user behavior (e.g., login, browse, add to cart, checkout).
Key Metrics to Monitor

•	Request Latency: I will monitor the time taken for requests to reach the server and return a response to identify network-related delays.

•	Error Rate: I will observe the percentage of failed requests to ensure services are stable under load.

•	Throughput (Requests per Second): I will measure the platform's ability to process a large number of requests without performance degradation.

•	CPU and Memory Utilization: I will monitor the CPU and memory usage of microservices to identify bottlenecks.

•	Database Performance: I will track query execution times and database throughput for both MySQL and DynamoDB.

•	Auto-scaling Response Time: I will ensure auto-scaling policies kick in promptly during traffic surges, validating timely resource scaling.
Simulating Peak Load

I will use historical data to configure load tests that simulate peak traffic patterns, including sudden traffic spikes and sustained high traffic. Failure scenarios will also be tested, such as database or service downtime.

5. ## Conclusion
By conducting a thorough root cause analysis, implementing a robust scaling strategy, and performing load testing, we can ensure the platform is well-prepared to handle future peak traffic. My approach emphasizes scalability, resilience, and performance optimization, providing a solid foundation for reliable service during critical business events.
Thank you for the opportunity to present this assessment. I am open to discussing any part of the process for further clarification.
